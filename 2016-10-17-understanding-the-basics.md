    <td>The way in which me and Tomy worked was that we took turns to type and to read out the instructions. If the program was typed wrongly the person reading out the instructions would attempt to either correct the mistake or redo the program. I think that this strategy worked well because we were able to finish before the lesson was over.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that both me and Tomy need to work on understanding the errors that we make. This is due to the fact that when we make a fair big mistake in the program we just start again. Although we did work quickly this wastes time. We also need to work on trying to share the keyboard equally because some lessons Tomy has the keyboard whereas some lessons I have the keyboard.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time we need to try and make sure that we actually understand how the program works so that we can correct our mistakes successfully without starting again. Furthermore I think we need to spend less time on the things that don't matter like what colour the writing should be. By doing these things I am confident that both of us can get more out of the lesson and learn more about scripting</td>
