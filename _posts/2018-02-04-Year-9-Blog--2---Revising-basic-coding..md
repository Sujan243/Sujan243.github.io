  <tr>
    <td>I learnt, firstly by listening to the teacher at the front of the class and watch him recap the basic codes. Then I applied my learning and tried to write out the codes on my computer. I found most of the codes quite easy to do except for the loops which kept coming up with error statements. The strategies that were effective were persevering until I found the answer because although it took me 15 minutes to finish my code. In the end I was able to find the answer.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>That thing that limited my learning was the fact that I wasn't as switched on as usual. Due to the fact that it was a Monday morning and the first lesson after half term, I found hard to concentrate. I need to work on waking up a bit earlier so I can feel more refreshed before the lesson starts. Furthermore, I feel that I need to raise my hand more in lessons so I can be more engaged in class discussions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to wake up early and have a better breakfast so I feel more boosted for the upcoming day. This is because during the lesson I felt tired and less 'ready to learn than usual.' Furthermore, I could sleep earlier on Sundays so I have more time to sleep. This will improve my learning because by have a better breakfast and sleeping earlier I will feel more energised and less tired than usual.</td>
