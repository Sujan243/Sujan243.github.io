    <td> today I learned by using codecademy once again. The way in which I learnt was following the instructions given in each of the lessons. I then made the script according to the instructions. This strategy was effective because when I got the script wrong, I would always receive the information on why the code was wrong and would then be able to correct the code</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the thing that limited my learning was the fact that like last week I wasted a lot of time because I was making little errors that the programme didn't pick up. For example, I wrote Print in capital letters and On that code I spent a long time because I thought that something else was wrong.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will ensure that I write my command words in lowercase so I don't waste time trying to figure out why my code went wrong. Another thing that I think I should do to improve my learning is to stop being tempted to look at my partner's work because that way I don't learn as much.</td>
