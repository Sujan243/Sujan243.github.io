  <tr>
    <td>Tuesday - on Tuesday the strategy I used was that when I was doing a task and I had got it wrong a couple of times then I tried to figure out the which topic the part that I got wrong was in and I took a look at how I had done the particular exercise. This was helpful because I was able to do more tasks.
Thursday - My strategy was similar to the one I used on Tuesday but instead of going back to check a certain code all the time I tried to decrease the amount of times I checked something.
Saturday - on Saturday my strategy stayed the same but once again I tried to stop looking back at other exercises. This worked especially well because on Saturday I only looked at another exercise 3 times.

  <tr>
    <td>Tuesday - Thing that limited my learning was that when I found something hard and I had tried the exercise 3 or 4 times and had got it wrong, I just checked how I had done something and I was able to get the answer.
Thursday - I started doing my work on Codecademy quite late today which limited my learning because I felt quite sleepy.
Saturday - There wasn't really anything to work on because I had solved the fact that I had checked other pieces of code and started doing codecademy early after school.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tuesday -  the thing I would change for next time is that I would not check the code I had got wrong, as many times.
Thursday - I would start working on Codecademy a lot earlier so I don't feel sleepy
Saturday -I wouldn't change anything because I was focused, I only checked other code 3 times and I started doing Codecademy just after school.</td>
