    <td>In this lesson we learnt in a slightly different way. In the last lesson we'd learnt less because we were just rushing through the tasks so in this lesson we spent more time on each instruction. We also learnt more by doing this. One other thing we did was letting both people in the pair type an equal amount of the sets of instructions so that one person wasn't constantly typing and the other person wasn't constantly reading out the instructions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>There were fewer things that limited our learning this week because we acted upon our reflections. Nevertheless I think that we need to pay closer attention to where we are saving our work. This is because we firstly saved our work in the wrong place and we had to ask the teacher how to put the work into our usb sticks.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In order to improve our learning, for the next lesson I am going to initially try to save our work in the right place first time round. This is because I both me and my partner will waste less time and this gives us more time to learn. One other thing I think that we can do for next lesson is to set up the computer more quickly. This is because I think that we spent too much trying to find the right parts for our computer. In conclusion I think that both me and my partner need to waste less time and get to work quickly.</td>
