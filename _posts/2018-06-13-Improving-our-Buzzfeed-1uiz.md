    <td>We learnt by trying new methods each time one method didn't work. For example, I tried play my Buzzfeed quiz over and over again and improving it as I went along. The red crosses on the side of the page helped because they showed me which parts of the code didnâ€™t work</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the thing that limited my learning was the time it took to replay my code and keep restyling the answers in order to find mistakes within my code and collect ideas as to how I could improve the code. For example it took me a long time to decide what sort of question I could ask the user in order to make my code more complex and accurate.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to think more in my head instead of replaying the code every time I want to find a mistake or find a way to improve my code. This will make me faster when I am making my code and also get me more engaged whilst I am making my code because I am concentrating more and thinking more.</td>
