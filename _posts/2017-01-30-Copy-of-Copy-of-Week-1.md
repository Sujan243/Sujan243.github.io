    <td>today we learnt by using codecademy for the first half of the lesson but for the second half of the lesson the teacher talked about how we shouldn't just give our peers the answers and that we should either give them hint and clues or just let them figure it out for themselves. He also told us that if we spoonfed them the answer, then they wouldn't learn. All you would be doing is giving them a short term answer.</td>

    <td>the thing that limited my learning this week was the fact that I found it quite hard to find one of the answers to one of the scripts. I sort of found it frustrating, but the good thing was, due to the fact that our teacher gave us a talk on not giving up and not asking our partners on what to do on the questions</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the thing that I will work on for next time is trying a lot harder before giving up. I think that this limited my learning because due to the fact that I started getting frustrated my concentration levels also started going down and I started to work a lot slower. I think that I should do this because I believe that if I do this then I will be able to get a lot more done in the lesson .Furthermore I think I can improve this by just bringing water to the lesson.</td>
