    <td>I learnt by doing different Buzzfeed quizzes on the internet and looking at how they were written in order to find an answer. For example one of the quizzes that I did guessed what animal you were by asking a few questions. I learnt that these quizzes must have a scoring variable and if I was to make my own code I would need to use scores for the final answer. We then went to the front of the classroom where the teacher told us about other methods we could use. I found doing the quiz most helpful, firstly because it was fun but also because I was actually doing the quiz.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>the thing that limited my learning my learning was the fact that at first I was just doing the question on the questions and wasn't really understanding what the point of the exercise was. It was only after Mr Keane stopped us and talked about creating our own quizzes that I actually understood the point of the exercise. Next time I could try to focus more whilst during the exercise instead of thinking about what I could have done after I'd finished the exercise.

    <td>Next time I will try to focus more whilst doing an activity so that I understand the point of the activity and I 'watch out for' what we are meant to be learning about. For example, in this we were meant to be learning about how to score and get the final outcome in our own results.</td>
