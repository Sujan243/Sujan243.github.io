    <td>I learnt today by firstly using codecademy to progress in my learning of python, but later on in the lesson our teacher taught us how to divide our code to make it more readable when it was displayed on GitHub which was very helpful because now I know how and when to use table headers and table divisions</td>

  <tr>
    <td>the thing that limited my learning was the fact that when we were learning about the table headers I forgot to make notes and although I was able to listen to the teacher with better attention I made less notes as I couldn't remember everything that was said.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time If the teacher is talking to us then I will make notes so that later on I can refer to my notes at home if I forget a certain code. Another thing I will do to improve my learning is try make my background a moving background using GitHub to engage the person that is looking at my blog</td>
