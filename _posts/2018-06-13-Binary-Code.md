    <td>This week Mr Keane showed us each of the codes and explained how to convert between each code. We learnt that Binary is in Base 2. Every odd number has a 1 on the end and every even number has a 0 on the end. A 0 means that a number isn't counted and a 1 means that it is. You work your way up the scale of 0s and 1s and add every value that has a 1 under it. In hexadecimal the numbers are in base 6. A=10,B=11,C=12,D=13,E=14 and F=15, whilst all numbers up to 9 are the same. For example 9F would be 9*16 + 15 which would be 144</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Thing that limited my learning was the fact that when converting from Binary and Hexadecimal back to normal I found it hard  and instead of finding another way to do the questions I wasted time using the same method. If I had listened more carefully I wouldâ€™ve learnt another method which could be used to convert back to base 10.

    <td>Next time I will listened more carefully when the teacher is explaining something important so I can apply it during the lesson and find it easier to solve questions which will be given. This will help me finish more quickly so that I am not left behind.</td>
