  <tr>
    <td>We were reviewing and marking other people's blogs so the strategy that I found most effective was going through each of the headings that our peers would be marked for and then giving them a mark. I think that this strategy was quite effective due to the fact that in the end I was able to give my peer a lot of feedback and also an accurate grade. I learned quite a lot from this because by looking at other people's blogs I was able to learn from their mistakes but also take the good bits from their blog and put it into mine</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This week their was very little that I think limited my learning. This may be because I improved from my mistakes from previous weeks. The habit that I think I need to change is the fact that I don't put my hand up enough because sometimes I am scared that I will get the answer wrong</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time in order to improve my learning I will firstly add in the improvements to my blog by learning from my peers achievements and failures. Another way that I will Improve my learning is by learning from my own mistakes and using the feedback of my peer who marked my work to also improve my work. Finally I will try to arrive more abruptly to lessons and arrange music lessons at different times because I feel as though I am missing a lot of It lessons.
