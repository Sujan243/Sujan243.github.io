    <td>Last week I found it hard to concentrate, due to the fact that I was still tired due to the fact that it was a Monday morning. This week I woke up earlier and had gone to sleep earlier the night before which made it easier for me in the lesson to understand what the teacher was saying and apply it into my own code. This was a big improvement from last week and was an effective strategy.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the thing that limited my learning was the fact that I was late for the lesson due to the fact that we had a presentation on mental health and we overrun slightly. I should have walked quickly to IT, instead of walking slowly and talking to my friends. I missed about 5 mins of the lesson which could have been used learning about loops. I think I need to work on walking promptly to lesson in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to walk to lessons more quickly if our form time overruns so that I don't miss so much of the lesson in future. This will improve my learning because it will give me more time in the lesson. The extra five mins might help me to understand a particular topic in the future.
