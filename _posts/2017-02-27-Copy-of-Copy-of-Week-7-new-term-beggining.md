    <td>like the last lesson I learnt by using codecademy once again and following the instructions in order to learn about each of the topics. I felt that this topic was useful because I found it easy to find where the problem was because when I submitted the code, if I was wrong it showed me exactly what was wrong.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact that in the lesson I found it difficult to complete one of the tasks which required me to combine all my learning from the variables topic. I think that I was able to use variables very easily when I was doing little tasks but when I was required  to do more complex tasks I found it a bit more difficult. I can work on this by maybe going back one task so that I can understand where I am going wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing I will change for next time is that if I find that I am finding a task difficult then I will go back in order to understand  where I am going wrong. I think that this is important because it will be easier for me to improve. Finally I would also like to improve in my coding skills by being able to fix a problem quickly because I take a lot of time to find the problem and change my code</td>
