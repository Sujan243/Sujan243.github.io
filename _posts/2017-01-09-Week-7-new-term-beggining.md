    <td>The way in which we learnt was, we were  shown a video about persevering and not giving  up, the teacher then explained that we shouldn't just give up so easily and that we should keep trying until  we eventually reach  our goal. This strategy was effective because, due to the fact that I was shown a visual example of perseverance I understood what the teacher was talking about better. I also found it helpful when our teacher explained that when we find a specific  code tricky we should experiment and find a way of solving the problem</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was just the basic fact  that  I wasn’t able to put my hand up enough. I knew the answer but I think I was worried that I’d get it  wrong. I think that I shouldn’t be so worried that i’ll answer  the question wrong  and go for it a bit more. Something that limited my learning this week was the fact that because some of our class thought we had drama instead of  IT we went to the drama studio instead which meant that we didn’t have a much time a we would have like to have .</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In order to improve my learning, next time I will put my hand up more and contribute to class discussions more as well. After this lesson I also think that I should be more independant on my tasks and not ask for so much help from the teacher and my peers.This lesson has also taught me that when I find something really difficult I shouldn’t  just give up, but just try  and try again until I find the answer. The final thing that I learnt from this lesson is that you should learn from your mistakes.
