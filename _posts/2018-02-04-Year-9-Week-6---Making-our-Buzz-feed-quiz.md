    <td>I learnt firstly by watching the teacher programmed  his code and told us what to do when starting our codes. For homework we had already been told to write the questions necessary for our quiz so that we would already be prepared for the lesson. I think this was a good strategy because we were able to progress more quickly do to our preparation. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact that due to that fact that when the teacher was explaining the work I found it quite difficult. When I went back to my computer I wasn't really sure what to do and therefore I looked at the teacher's code and typed it into my computer ; instead I should have asked for help.

    <td>Next time I will ask the person sitting next to me or the teacher for help instead of just copying the teacher and 'Cheating.â€™ This will help me to understand better and give me a long term answer instead of just and short term answer for just that particular code.</td>
