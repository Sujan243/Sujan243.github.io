    <td>Once again we used codecademy to learn, we worked through the exercises on codecademy in order to improve our knowledge in IT. I found it especially helpful when our teacher, Mr Keane gave me part of the code and gave me hints on a certain exercise because I was finding it challenging. This strategy was most effective for me in that lesson.

  <tr>
    <td>the thing that limited my learning today was the fact that on the exercise that I found most difficult I just stared at the screen and hoped for the best instead of actually trying different pieces of code. The habit I need to work on is going back to exercises that I haven't done to check how I did something instead of just sitting in the lessons and hoping for the best.</td>

    <td>thing that I will change for next time is going back to check a part of code that I didn't know instead of just staring at the screen. Another thing I will do in order to improve my learning is during the week I should practice using python on codecademy more often so I don't forget in the lesson.</td>
