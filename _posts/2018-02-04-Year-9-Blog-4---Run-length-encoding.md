    <td>Today we had a trainee teacher who,going a bit off topic from repl.it, taught us how we can use compression. By using compression, you reduce the number of grid squares containing anything, and so the number of 'bytes' used.  By doing this we could create pictures, starting off with fewer squares - Pacman and Space Invaders both have very visible pixels.  I created a space invader out of black and green pixels or grid squares.  I then gave the compressed code to somebody else for them to turn into the picture.

    <td>During this lesson I found the Run Length encoding topic quite hard but was hesitant to ask for help during the lesson. I felt that I wasted quite a lot of time during this lesson. The habit I need to work on is asking questions if I am stuck on a particular task instead of just sitting there, thinking of a way to find an answer</td>

    <td>Next time I will ask the teacher for help if I am in trouble. This will help me to waste less time and move on to the next task quicker. During this lesson I wasn't able to finish all of the tasks and I would like to improve this in the future.</td>
