    <td>We were showed a website in the lesson called codecademy, after the teacher talked to us about it we were told to go on the website and follow a tutorial that explained and gave us an understanding of what python was. This was the main way in which we learnt how to code this week. The strategy that I found most effective though was sometimes experimenting why I got something wrong instead of just looking at the hint and finding myself a short term answer.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I don't think that anything limited my learning this but if I was being extremely picky It would have to be the fact that I arrived slightly late to the lesson due to a music lesson, this may have limited my learning because I could have done a bit more work and progressed in the tutorial slightly further.Another thing that  limited my learning what the fact that I spent an extremely long time on one of the codes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to arrange my music lesson at a different to avoid it clashing with It so that I can get more done. Next time if I spend too much time on one script I will try to find the answer so that I can move on. The way in which I think that I can improve is trying harder scripts so that I can be more challenged. This important because otherwise I may not learn as much as possible .
