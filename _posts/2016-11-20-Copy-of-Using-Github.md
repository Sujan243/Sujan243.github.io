    <td>At the start of the lesson this week we had a problem because we thought our fuze box wasn't  working but after moving the wires around we soon found out that one of the plugs wasn’t connected properly. This week we learnt by testing out different scripts. This worked well because it helped us understand which pieces of texts worked and which didn’t.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I need to work on is not just asking my neighbours how to do something. I think that I should persevere more and keep on trying different codes. Although we did try different scripts, sometimes they didn’t work so we asked our neighbours to help. In short I would like to be more independent</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to follow the right steps when setting up my computer. This is because we wasted a lot of time trying to fix the computer, we shouldn’t just rush and do things wrong. Another thing that I would like to  do to improve my learning is to do things more independently because we asked our neighbouring pair  how to do things too many times</td>
