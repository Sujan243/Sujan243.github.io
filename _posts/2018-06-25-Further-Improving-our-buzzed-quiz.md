    <td>We learnt by trying quizzes on Buzzfeed and seeing how different quizzes works and how they had different strategies to find an end result. We tried a variety of quizzes meaning we were able to learn how to improve our buzzfeed quizzes. I changed my buzzfeed quiz by change the way in which to score was calculated to make the quiz more accurate</td>

    <td>The thing that limited my learning was how long it took me find strategies in order to improving my buzzfeed. It was only half way through the lesson that I felt I had tried enough questions to be comfortable in taking components from the quiz and putting them in my own work.</td>

    <td>In the future a better strategy may be to collect the quizzes I would like to do beforehand so that I have more time to work on my quiz. In future I want to be able to have more time to work in python so I don't waste valuable time in the lesson and can learn more about python which will also be useful for my computer science in the future during practical lesson</td>
