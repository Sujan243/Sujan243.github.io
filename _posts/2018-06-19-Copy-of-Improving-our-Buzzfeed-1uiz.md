    <td>We learnt by listening to the teacher explain How many things each bit system can hold. The teacher also explained what an overflow bit is. An overflow bit is when you have an extra bit on top of the 8 which are given. After this we were taught about a Binary shift. When we multiply a number by two we do a binary shift and shift the number one across to the left and one across to the right if we divide.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was finding it hard to abbreviate what was being said into small compact nots that were easily understandable. I found it hard to understand what an overflow bit was at first. It took me time to completely understand that it was when you had an extra bit on top of the normal 8 given. Furthermore, when we learning about RAM I was behind the class due to the fact that I didn't understand what RAM did or was.

    <td>Next time I will focus on making abbreviating my notes more carefully so that later, when i am revising I will be able to understand my notes more easily. After the lesson Monday I had to come home after the lesson and correct all of the notes that I made in the lesson because it made no sense. Also, I would like to make sure that I have some more background knowledge on the subject we are learning in the future so I can be "ahead of the class" and focus on understand the topic at a higher level instead of having to understand the topic we are learning at a basic level.</td>
