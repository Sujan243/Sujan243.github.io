    <td>Firstly we learnt by listening to the teacher and making notes on how a computer store ASCII and UNICODE.  I was able to gather that ASCII is 7 Bit but in order to make the computer able to properly ready the code they must be made 8 Bit by adding a 0 at the front and UNICODE is 8 bit but must be able to hold more things to hold languages such as Mandarin and Arabic as they have many letters. After this we learnt by watching an animation on how a computer stores and uses basic operations on numbers, after each step we were told to predict what the computer would do to process and display the number on the display output.

  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that fact that I was unable to completely understand what the computer was doing in the lesson and therefore had to come home and research the topic to have a better understanding of what the computer does. I felt as though I was on the right lines to understanding it, but when played the animation I wasn't able to predict what would happen after each step.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future I will ask more lesson during the lesson so I donâ€™t have this problem when I come home. Instead of being slightly stuck I should ask more questions so I can eliminate any doubts that come into my head in this topic. For example, when I was stuck on how to add hexadecimal numbers I asked some questions and was able to find the answers to questions from then on. </td>
