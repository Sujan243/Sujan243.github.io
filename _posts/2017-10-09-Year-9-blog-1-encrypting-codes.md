    <td>Firstly I learnt by listening to Mr Tansley speak about different ways that you can use coding in order to send a message. Firstly learnt that you can make a code by changing the letters. For example the letter "A" could be “Z” and the letter “B” could be “Y”. We found out that although this could was effective, people could easily figure it out. Mr Tansley also talked about how you could use a word at the start of the code and keep the same letters after. For example you could put ice cream at the front of your coded alphabet and put the other letters after.  We wrote our coded alphabet below the real alphabet. Afterwards we used the VLOOKUP function in order to encrypt our code. I typed in    =VLOOKUP(D5,$A5:$B30,2) in order to encrypt my code.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was the fact that I had to keep looking at the board to check how to use the VLOOKUP function. I need to work on being more independent instead of trying to find the easy way out and looking at the board if I am having a difficulty with my code. This is because I find that if I work out how to do things on my own I remember them more easily that if I find the easy way out and copy the code of the board.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will endeavour to be a lot more independent so that I can improve my learning. The reason I would like to be more independent, is that I feel that I don't learn as much when I ask someone what to do.  I would also like to use more complex codes in upcoming lessons in order to stretch myself more.
