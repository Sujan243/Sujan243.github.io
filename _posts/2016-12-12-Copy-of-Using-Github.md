    <td>This week we learnt by using a different method. Half way through the lesson we thought about what we were doing wrong. For example, when we were doing our robot code we had a few problems as when I pressed f2 to run our program the screen kept showing that there was an error on a particular line. So, at this stage we read through the book to see what was wrong and we eventually figured it out.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning this week was the fact that we wasted to much time trying to play around with the robot arm when we should have just been trying to pick up the objects as that was our target for the lesson. We spent more time on things that weren't our aim and that's one of the reasons why we didn't reach our aim this week .</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will firstly waste less time and focus more on the aim of the lesson. This is so I will waste less time and we can get more done. Furthermore, I think that we should experiment less with the robot arm after we programme the script because we go more off task by doing this. One other thing that I think we should do to improve our learning is to get our equipment  ready more quickly because we spent too much time fixing the computer and collecting the equipment.</td>
