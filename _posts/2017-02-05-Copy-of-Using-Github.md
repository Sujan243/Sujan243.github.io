    <td>This week we learnt by using Codecademy. We moved through tasks and we were told what do by the instructions from codecademy. This strategy was effective because when I found it hard to the task I had the option to look at the hint and because of the hint I found it much easier to simplify the task and find the answer. By doing this I also found it easier to learn about the subject.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was due to the fact there was a hint I was too tempted to use it. Furthermore I think that I shouldn't have pressed the hint button on some of the tasks because I feel as though I didn't try the task enough times before I pressed the hint button. Next time I will try to do the task a few more times if I find it difficult before pressing the hint button.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is to firstly stop getting tempted to press the hint button too many times. This will improve my learning because I will not take the easy way out of the problem and instead I will be forced to find the answer the hard way. One of the minor changes that I need to make is not getting confused when writing command words such as Print. This is because I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why my code wasn't working. In the wand I eventually figured out that it was because I wrote Print with a capital p.</td>
