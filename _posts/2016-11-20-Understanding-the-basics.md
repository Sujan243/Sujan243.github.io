The way in which me and Tomy worked was that we took turns to type and to read out the instructions. If the program was typed wrongly the person reading out the instructions would attempt to either correct the mistake or redo the program. I think that this strategy worked well because we were able to finish before the lesson was over.</td>

    <td>
I think that both me and Tomy need to work on understanding the errors that we make. This is due to the fact that when we make a fairly big mistake in the program we just start again. Although we did work quickly this wastes time. We also need to work on trying to share the keyboard more equally throughout the lessons because some most lessons Tomy has the keyboard whereas I only have the keyboard occasionally. For example, both me and Tomy were learning how to change the colour of the text and I only used the keyboard for 2 scripts</td>

    <td>
Next time we need to try and make sure that we actually understand how the program works so that we can correct our mistakes successfully without starting again. Furthermore I think we need to spend less time on the things that don't matter like what colour the writing should be. By doing these things I am confident that both of us can get more out of the lesson and learn more about scripting</td>
